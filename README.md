# Lip Reading using Deep Learning

A real-time android application which captures video frames from a person speaking a particular word and run the trained inference model to predict the spoken word. 

## Implementation

* The Feature Extraction Stage is carried out by a HOG-SVM classifier pretrained to detect 68 landmark points on a given face. 
* The features surrounding the lip-region are stored in the form of Euclidean Distances. 
* These 20 features from each frame (29 frames in total with 2 frames clipped from the start and the end) are fed into LSTM layers
* The output of the final LSTM layer is attached to FC layers, which give the probabilistic output corresponding to each word.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
